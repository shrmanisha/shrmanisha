## About me

Hi, I am Shruti!! 

Whether it's crafting clean, efficient code, diving into new programming languages, or just tinkering with projects that push the boundaries of technology, the joy of coding is something we both share. There's nothing quite like the thrill of solving a complex problem, building something from scratch, or simply making an idea come to life through lines of code.

Let's embark on this coding journey together, where the possibilities are endless, and the learning never stops. Happy coding!
